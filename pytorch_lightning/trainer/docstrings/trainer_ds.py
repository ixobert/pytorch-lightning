                Default: ``os.getcwd()``.
                Can be remote file paths such as `s3://mybucket/path` or 'hdfs://path/'

            gradient_clip_val: 0 means don't clip.

                If enabled and `gpus` is an integer, pick available
                gpus automatically. This is especially useful when
                GPUs are configured to be in "exclusive mode", such
                that only one process at a time can access them.

            tpu_cores: How many TPU cores to train on (1 or 8) / Single TPU to train on [1]

            log_gpu_memory: None, 'min_max', 'all'. Might slow performance

                    Use `overfit_batches` instead. Will be removed in 0.10.0.

            track_grad_norm: -1 no tracking. Otherwise tracks that p-norm. May be set to 'inf' infinity-norm.

            check_val_every_n_epoch: Check val every n train epochs.

            val_percent_check:
                .. warning:: .. deprecated:: 0.8.0

                    Use `limit_val_batches` instead. Will remove v0.10.0.

            test_percent_check:
                .. warning:: .. deprecated:: 0.8.0

                    Use `limit_test_batches` instead. Will remove v0.10.0.

            val_check_interval: How often to check the validation set. Use float to check within a training epoch,
                use int to check every n steps (batches).

            weights_summary: Prints a summary of the weights when training begins.

            weights_save_path: Where to save weights if specified. Will override default_root_dir
                    for checkpoints only. Use this if for whatever reason you need the checkpoints
                    stored in a different place than the logs written in `default_root_dir`.
                    Can be remote file paths such as `s3://mybucket/path` or 'hdfs://path/'
                    Defaults to `default_root_dir`.

            amp_backend: The mixed precision backend to use ("native" or "apex")

            amp_level: The optimization level to use (O1, O2, etc...).

            num_sanity_val_steps: Sanity check runs n validation batches before starting the training routine.
                Set it to `-1` to run all batches in all validation dataloaders. Default: 2

            truncated_bptt_steps: Truncated back prop breaks performs backprop every k steps of much longer
                sequence.

            resume_from_checkpoint: To resume training from a specific checkpoint pass in the path here.
                This can be a URL.

            profiler:  To profile individual steps during training and assist in identifying bottlenecks.

            reload_dataloaders_every_epoch: Set to True to reload dataloaders every epoch.

            auto_lr_find: If set to True, will `initially` run a learning rate finder,
                trying to optimize initial learning for faster convergence. Sets learning
                rate in self.lr or self.learning_rate in the LightningModule.
                To use a different key, set a string instead of True with the key name.

            replace_sampler_ddp: Explicitly enables or disables sampler replacement. If not specified this
                will toggled automatically when DDP is used. By default it will add ``shuffle=True`` for
                train sampler and ``shuffle=False`` for val/test sampler. If you want to customize it,
                you can set ``replace_sampler_ddp=False`` and add your own distributed sampler.

            benchmark: If true enables cudnn.benchmark.

            deterministic: If true enables cudnn.deterministic.

            terminate_on_nan: If set to True, will terminate training (by raising a `ValueError`) at the
                end of each training batch, if any of the parameters or the loss are NaN or +/-inf.

            auto_scale_batch_size: If set to True, will `initially` run a batch size
                finder trying to find the largest batch size that fits into memory.
                The result will be stored in self.batch_size in the LightningModule.
                Additionally, can be set to either `power` that estimates the batch size through
                a power search or `binsearch` that estimates the batch size through a binary search.

            prepare_data_per_node: If True, each LOCAL_RANK=0 will call prepare data.
                Otherwise only NODE_RANK=0, LOCAL_RANK=0 will prepare data

fit = r"""
        Runs the full optimization routine.

        Args:
            model: Model to fit.

            train_dataloader: A Pytorch
                DataLoader with training samples. If the model has

                Pytorch Dataloader or a list of them, specifying validation samples.

                If ``None``, use the weights from the last epoch to test. Default to ``best``.

            verbose: If True, prints the test results

        Returns:
            The final test result dictionary. If no test_epoch_end is defined returns a list of dictionaries
